# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run. Updated on 28 Oct 2020

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains data about bank marketing. We seek to predict if a customer subscribed to a fixed term deposit, which is a column 'y' in our data.
So, our target column or label column will be 'y' which we going to predict.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
I loaded the data from the provided source url with TabularDatasetFactory. The data is then cleaned and normalized with training set of 20 percent and
test set of 80%.It used the LogisticRegression to train the model.

As we are going to predict for discrete, I am using the discreate hyper parameter.
I am using RandomParameterSampling with choice of max iteration from 10,20 or 30. and for RegularizationValue of C uniform from 0.5 to 1.
I am using BanditPolicy as the early stopping policy with slack_factor=0.1,evaluation_interval=1 and delay_evaluation=5.



## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
AutoML: Less code , easy to develop and efficient
