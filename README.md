# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data about bank marketing. We seek to predict if a customer subscribed to a fixed term deposit, which is a column 'y' in our data.
So, our target column or label column will be 'y' which we going to predict.
The best performing model was "VotingEnsemble" with accuracy of 0.9143. The model "StackEnsemble" which has a metric "0.9134" is also closed to "VotingEnsemble."

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
I loaded the data from the provided source url with TabularDatasetFactory. The data is then cleaned and normalized with training set of 20 percent and
test set of 80 percent.It used the LogisticRegression to train the model.

As we are going to predict for Discrete, I am using the discreate hyper parameter.
I am using RandomParameterSampling with choice of max iteration from 10,20 or 30. and for RegularizationValue of C uniform from 0.5 to 1.
I am using BanditPolicy as the early stopping policy with slack_factor=0.1,evaluation_interval=1 and delay_evaluation=5.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
For the RegularizationValue I choose uniform(0.5,1) and for Max iteration it will choose from (10,20,30).

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
I used BanditPolicy as the early stopping policy. On this one , the early termination is based on slack factor and evaluation interval and delay evaluation.



## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**


## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**


## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
AutoML: Less code , easy to develop and efficient
